{"name":"Led Sensor","tagline":"Turn an led into a sensor using an ATMega328P","body":"### Description\r\nThe ledsensor project uses an led sensor to detect light. Led are extremely similar to photo diodes which make them good cheap light sensor. A benefit of using leds as light sensors is that they only detect the light that is the same color as they emit. That means that if you use a red led as a sensor, you can have a blue led right next to it and it won't detect the light. This is a simple project that turns on two blue LED's when there is not enough light. **Note: LED's can sense white light because white light is made of all colors. Therefore they also can sense ambient light outside or in a house.**\r\n\r\n### The Hardware\r\nThe microchip that I use is the ATMega328P. I use three LED's, one red LED for detecting light and two blue LED's for . One button is for lighting the LED even if there is not too much light. If You do not want to use that button just connect the INT0 pin (pin 4) to high. Any power system that outputs 5v will work for the code I made. I added a reset pin but that is optional too.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nAll of the source code can be found on Github. The code basically checks if the led senses light and if there is not enough light than it will light two LED's. There is an external interrupt that can be fired if the INT0 pin is connected to ground. It will light up the LED.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nPlease add any issues you can find and I am open to any pull requests. I am thinking about making code that can accept serial information via a red led to another led.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
